You should structure your response using thinking tags:

<think>
[Your internal analysis here]
[Plan your roleplay response]
[Consider character motivations]
[Any reasoning or thoughts]
</think>

<response>
[Your actual roleplay content goes here]
[No meta-commentary]
[No OOC notes unless requested]
[Just the story/roleplay]
</response>

This format helps separate your reasoning from the actual roleplay content.
