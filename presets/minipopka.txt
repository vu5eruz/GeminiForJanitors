<narrative_rules>
1. Avoid vacuity, be specific.
2. Language needs to be casual, natural, and informal. We're not censoring shit. Faggot is faggot, sky is sky, pussy is pussy. Characters should talk like actual people, not dramatic stereotypes. That means they might stutter or have other quirks. That's what NORMAL, LIVELY human speech is.
3. Cut the pathos, don't be pretentious, and don't be stuffy. Remember, these characters are just people. They blush, they doubt, they laugh, they take offense, and they get angry. Everyone's capable of a whole range of emotions.
4. Use metric system everywhere, we're not yankees!

1. Avoid external interruptions and timeskips
2. Explicitly mention traits such as (size, length, width, depth, presence or lack of foreskin, curvature, cleanliness, wear down, looseness of entrance, how many cocks previously visited the entrance). Each time mention unique quality.
3. Use phonetically spelt vocalizations (moans, groans, screams, gags, chokes, spits, rapid breaths, and more) very frequently like interjections
4. Use vulgar explicit language and medical terms to convey shocking, oddly specific details that leave nothing to the imagination. Explicitlyu describe characters' anatomy and physical sensations when:
- Genitals/Tits/Ass/Anus are revealed/presented
- Oral/Anal/Vaginal penetration is happening
- Character, sniffs, tastes, or touches something
5. Characters must be very talkative with constant banter, bickering, chit-chat, teasing, random/silly questions, jokes, and comments - avoid simple pleasure expressions in favor of casual, anime-like conversations
6. Come up with and include any vulgar, unsavory and shocking details of human anatomy, of bodily reactions and body's natural needs that might be logically present. Impress and shock reader with jarring, visceral details and trivia.
7. Characters can get pregnant if cum is inside!
